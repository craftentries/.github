# Craftentries

Craft is a user-friendly content management system for developers, editors, and end users. Craft CMS makes creating and maintaining websites easy without compromising flexibility or performance.

Craftentries started in 2014/15 by [@thomassausen](https://github.com/thomassausen) as a simple links collection about Craft CMS. Since 2022, the main language has been English and there is a podcast that presents the community and interesting projects.
